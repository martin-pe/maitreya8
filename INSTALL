Installation instructions for Maitreya
======================================

Here you can get some hints for successful compilation. These steps are NOT required if you donwloaded the binary package.

1. Installation on UNIX-like systems 
====================================

The distribution is based on automake, so the traditional configure/make
should be sufficient on most systems.

The compilation should work on most UNIX or Linux Systems. The program is
known to compile on systems like Redhat Linux, Debian, SuSE and FreeBSD. 

Prerequisites
-------------

You must have installed wxWidgets including the headers. Versions 3.0 or 2.8 both work.

Most platforms provide ready-to-use prebuild packages.

Example list for wx 2.8 installation on Ubuntu Feisty is

    * libwxbase2.8-0
    * libwxbase2.8-dev
    * libwxgtk2.8-0
    * wx2.8-headers

Most platforms have only 2 or 3 required packages. We recommend UNICODE packages if 
your platform provides ansi and unicode versions of the software.
If not mentioned, unicode will be most likely the default.

You can also compile wx from source code, see http://www.wxwidgets.org.

configure
---------

Let's assume that you installed wxWidgets.

Default installation directory is /usr/local/maitreya.

If you want to change this type

 ./configure --prefix=<directory>

where <directory> could be something like '/usr' or '/opt'. All will be installed under
/usr/maitreya or /opt/maitreya etc.

ALL the data are installed  under $(prefix)/maitreya.
So there's nothing under /usr/local/share/icons, etc. Only a link from
/usr/local/bin/maitreya to the main binary will be created.
prefix is /opt).

The wx-config script is essential for the platform dependent compiler switches.
configure must find it, otherwise there's no chance to compile the program
well. wx-config is searched in various standard directories. If configure
doesn't find your wx-config, start configure with the option

 --with-wx-config-dir=<directory>

The resulting executable (src/gui/maitreya) will be quite big. You can strip if you don't
want debugging informations (strip src/gui/maitreya).

Please read the font installation note after compilation. The font "MaitreyaSymbols.ttf" from
the directory "src/fonts" must be installed onto your system.

- End of *nix notes

2. Installation on Win32 systems
================================

You can use either MS Visual Studio Express 2005 or MinGW compiler.

Visual Studio Express 2008
--------------------------

Visual Studio Express 2008 can be downloaded for free.

Please follow the isntallation instructions. You must register for Visual Studio, it's for free.

wxWidgets compilation is straight forward. The project files are located under build/msw.
Recommeded target for first time compilation is the "Unicode Debug" target.

Please read the wx documentation for more details.

The environment variable WXWIN must be set to the directory of the wxWidgets installation (e.g. d:\wxWidgets-2.8.7). 

The Maitreya project is located in "maitreya.sln" in the root directory of the package.
The batch script "setup_vcpp_resources.bat" can be used to copy the necessary directories (with language resources etc).

Compilation should be done for the target "Unicode Debug". This must be same as before in wx compilation.

Make "gui" the main project (right click on the project context menu).

Main target of the project is the executable "maitreya.exe" in the directory "src/gui".

Remark: older versions of Developer Studio (like 5.0 or 6.0 and Visual Studio Express 2005) are not supported by the software.

MinGW
-----

The compilation with MinGW is more complicated. 

First step: install MingW

Second step: Installation of wxWidgets
--------------------------------------

Get the source code for wxWidgets from wxwidgets.org. You can fetch either the
windows packages (like wx-msw) or the wxAll package. Unpack the source code
and read the documentation under doc/msw.

Go to the the root directory of the wxWidgets source code distribution.

Type
 ./configure --disable-shared --enable-unicode
 make
 make install

You can also leave the option --disable-shared. You will then get a shared
library of wxWidgets. The release will be bigger then.

If everything goes well, you'll have a ready-to-use wxWidgets installation.

You can test your installation by compiling one of the samples (e.g. samples
minimal). Just go to the directory, type
 make 
and start the example.


Third step: Installation of Maitreya
------------------------------------
Create a directory for the source code tree, e.g. c:\maitreya. Enter this
directory.

Unpack the source code archive either by
unzip <path>/maitreya-<version>.zip (zip file)

or tar jxvf <path>/maitreya-<version>.tar.bz2 (bzip2 file)

Type
 make -f Makefile.win

Hope that everything's going right.

The executable (src/gui/maitreya.exe) will be quite big. You can strip if you
don't want debugging informations (strip src/gui/maitreya.exe).

Note
-----
You need mingw DLL to start the program. So you must either start
the program from the mingw shell or you must provide these files (mingw*.dll).

These files are located n the msys or mingw directory. It's okay to copy them to the
place where the executable or Maitreya is located. Probably you can 
also copy them to the windows directory, try it.

- End of Windows notes

3. Compilation on MacOS X
=========================

The program compiles and runs on MacOS Snow Leopard.

Prerequisites are:
- GNU gcc and g++ (install xcode)
- statically linked version of wxWidgets for release package.
- wxWidgets from xcode works, too

Compilation of wxWidgets
- get wxWidgets 2.8, unpack it
- create folder for build, change to folder and call configure as follows

../configure --enable-unicode --disable-shared

Unpack the maitreya release and call configure 

CLAGS="-arch i386" CPPLAGS="-arch i386" configure --with-libfontconfig-prefix=/usr/X11 --with-wx-config=[path-to-wx-config]/wx-config

Calling the script "create_mac_release.sh" will create the release directory and application folder "Maitreya6.app" with required data

Create the disk image with
create_mac_release.sh dmg
